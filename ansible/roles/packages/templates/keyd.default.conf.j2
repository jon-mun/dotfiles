# --- 1. Physical Layout Swap ---
# Physical Alt becomes the "Command" layer (custom layer defined below)
leftalt = layer(command)
# Physical Win becomes Alt
leftmeta = layer(alt)

# --- 2. CapsLock to Escape ---
capslock = esc

# --- 3. The Command Layer (Mac Behavior for GUI Apps) ---
# This layer inherits from Meta (:M).
# If you press a key NOT listed here (like Enter), it sends Meta+Key.
# If you press a key listed here (like C), it sends Ctrl+Key.

# --- 4. Terminal Specifics (Kitty) ---
# We define a special layer just for the terminal.
# Goal: Cmd+C/V should send Ctrl+Shift+C/V (Standard Linux Term Copy/Paste)
# Goal: Cmd+Key should acts like Ctrl+Key for everything else (e.g. Cmd+L to clear screen)
